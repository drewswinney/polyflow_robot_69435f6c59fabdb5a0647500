# Robot Console

Vite + React app for connecting to a robot and adjusting configuration. Depends on `@polyflowrobotics/ui-components`.

## Scripts
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run preview`

## Notes
- Import your design system styles if provided, e.g. `import "@polyflowrobotics/ui-components/dist/style.css";`.
- The app currently stubs connection actions; wire them to your signaling/WebRTC layer as needed.
